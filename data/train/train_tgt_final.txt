it s a hard question but i m sure the reexamination of china s economic policies in the past may lead us to a right answer to the question after the establishment of new china our government employed numerous economics policies to stimulate the growth of china s economy these policies however favored our domestic enterprises and protected them from international competition and these policies have contributed a lot to the rapid growth of both china economy and our domestic enterprises after china s entry into to chinese domestic enterprises will have to compete with their foreign counterparts this new situation entails some changes of chinese economic policies these changes will spur chinese enterprises to strengthen their competitiveness in the long run

not really i did some research about chinese table manners the important rule is to remain silent while eating of course this refers to family meals only not talking over meals is supposed to be good for the health it is impolite if people do not talk to each other during a social party the table arrangements and serving order for a social party are equally complicated each dish should be placed in the correct position when fish is served the tail should be pointing at the guest because tail meat is supposed to be tasty if it is in winter the stomach should face the right hand side of the guest because that portion of the fish is very rich in winter each dish should be commenced by the eldest person who is seated at the head of the table the diners should sit close to the table so food won t drop on their cloths no noise should be made when chewing no one should move food back to the communal plate even if he doesn t like it one should drink soup slowly and is not supposed to make a lot of noise all these table manners are very similar to western habits
