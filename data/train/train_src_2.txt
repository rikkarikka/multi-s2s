what s wrong with him
yes you are right
what s wrong with him
great i ll see you on the 7th
yes that s her
why are you in such a hurry
i need all of my supplies right away
were you looking at a particular refrigerator
not yet if we can t find a lawyer for him then the state will appoint him with one
how would your colleagues evaluate you
that s not a big problem there are many small schools for adults like you who can study to be certified
good idea especially at this price
well i work very long hours ten hours a day is quite normal and if something important comes up i m often in the office until 8 or 9 in the evening
how would your colleagues evaluate you
most some drinks have too much sugar in them
great what do you think of it
what s wrong with him
well i think we d better go now we have to follow the guide
that sounds like a good idea
thanks a lot
what s wrong with him
oh i see i like to do those tests too but i don t take them seriously
yes that s her
thanks but i don t want to put you into any trouble
the pleasure is mine it s been nice talking with you goodbye

you can t be serious
i am supposed to go to liu ichang
what s wrong with him
i scheduled a delivery for tomorrow
what s wrong with him
yes i ve been through them and there s a problem a rather major discrepancy actually you see it should be kn509
what s wrong with him
i don t know much about him he died when i was just a baby even though i don t have a blood relationship with my step father and step brother i consider them to be my real family
yes that ll be all right well please tell me about your working experience
did they say for how long
oh why not i ll take em
perhaps that s because we hold different ideas about privacy
ok what else
how many in your party
the doctor has an opening at 10 30 tomorrow i ll put you down for then
how do you do i m ted nugent
you re glad he saved me huh
on the contrary i have been reading a lot of books about the subject

the facial will start with a thorough cleansing
i am sure we will
good idea
do you have the receipt with you
okay there are two customer service offices in your area the nearest one is chadwick and hacks appliances
what note i can t see i just pulled an all nighter
just remember to hold on to your ticket you need it to get out of the station when you get there
what s wrong with him
you might want to change your plans with the cold and wet weather that we re supposed to have tomorrow the roads are going to be rather slippery
any rain
perhaps that s because we hold different ideas about privacy
we are going to pack them in boxes with a colored picture of the blouse on it inside we ll use a transparent poly bag for the blouse ready for the window show you ll see that the blouses will appeal to the eye as well as to the purse
on the contrary i have been reading a lot of books about the subject

what s wrong with him
she said it was because we had very different ideas about life
ok what else

what s wrong with him

what did he take
yes the baked fish was out of this world
thanks a lot for calling us could you tell me more about what you need us to do

great let s go where is it
not yet if we can t find a lawyer for him then the state will appoint him with one

where did you buy it
thank you
hm they may ask you what kind of salary you have in mind or simply tell you what the company is offering i think the latter is more likely for a starting position especially if you have little experience and if they are seriously considering hiring you they will probably want to know when you would be available to start work and basically that s about it

is malibu beach nice

a sony it s only one third the size of my old camera and looks rather smart
i suppose you were happy to forget about the outside world
yes it s only 8 forty thanks so much
that s pretty much the same as i ve been quoted at other banks
and do you have the letter of acceptance from the university with you
mmmm it s hard to say i like golf a lot but i guess like skating better
i still have no idea what to do now
the national anthem of canada is o canada
i was thinking about the accident i saw in the morning i was petrified when two cars collided i witnessed the traffic accident

sorry my english isn t so good could you speak a little slower
you are so lucky they are on sale today it costs only 250 yuan pay at the counter over there
thank you how much is it
i call the landlord right now
a foot massage sounds like a great idea they are very relaxing i d also like to have a mudpack on my face it s supposed to help with your complexion
no need for that it s not usually busy on weekdays
i m sorry mr baker s not in may i take your message
i thought the special effects were amazing but i got a bit confused the plot was too complicated for me
yes disco dancing is my favorite it s great fun and good exercise as well
a single room costs you 85 day
i was too excited to sleep last night i didn t go to sleep until quite late
i ll pick you up around 8 00
where

i d be glad to he s really cute
no certainly not that s a reasonable restriction
i want to try different things before i find the one i really like
don t worry about it just leave it to the insurance companies
you ll be supervising six brokers who manage a combined total of 310 accounts
have you made a reservation
that s right the meeting is very important where shall the guests be received before the meeting begins

i think i m going to make myself some oatmeal and toast
i know but this year i want to get him an interesting tie like this one
come to my house this sunday my mom will not be at home then we can cook some wonderful fried food by ourselves
ok that would be great
what s up honey
mary you must be careful in some parts of america the day can be 10 c and sunny
your price is rather out of line much higher than we expected we can t buy with your offer
really how do you know that
i find it interesting
yes but i think it s probably for the best
thanks a lot by the way do you make the deliveries
i usually ask them if they want some food and then give them something to eat i figure that if they re homeless they re probably hungry
we don t have enough cash but i ll take my credit card
no but it is said the welfare in canada is very good
i guess so
since i did not have much staff i asked my cousin to help me out
i think that they don t complete the forms correctly or they don t include all the required documents the embassy is very strict about it you have to be quite careful
yes i ve finished
yes the same service and food as in the evening
i see i guess i should be more careful about what i read especially on the internet where you have no idea who anybody is
how do you use a public phone
sorry we re sold out right now please come back next week
actually i had a perfect plan for this afternoon but it is totally ruined by the sand storm i woke up this morning and found it was sunny so i called lucy and asked her to go shopping with me we were going to look for a new purse now it turned out to be like this neither of us wants to go to outside anymore
have you received any honors
well i was hoping you would do me a big favor that was supposed to be a rush order i forgot to tell you i m getting a lot of flak from my boss

yes i really need to have a good rest
yes the same service and food as in the evening

linda i wanted to tell you how much i enjoyed our time together last friday night
yes please have you any vacancies for tonight
well the real hackers mostly think crackers are lazy irresponsible and not very bright and feel that being able to break security does make you a hacker any more than being able to start cars without keys makes you an automotive engineer unfortunately many journalists and writers have been fooled into using the word hacker to describe crackers this irritates real hackers to no end
i have a bad headache
yeah
that s great i m looking to borrow quite a large sum though
the amount of english i know enables me to do general desk work i believe the amount of english i know is sufficient to work in a south korea firm

you ll be covered by our medical plan while on duty since you ll be middle anagement you re expected to be available up to one hour past normal working hours any approved overtime that will be paid at time which you can take as salary or time off
but that still sounds expensive

that s where you re making a big mistake you can t just guess peoples likes or sizes especially with clothes or jewelry on top of that i think that you should get your mom something that shows how much you love her at the same time you should show her that you took the time and effort to look for something that she would really like
i feel that people can love who they want

what you said gives me the creeps
i have worked here long time
ah ha i thought so
actually it suggest english the main argument is that english is already being studied as a second language in most countries china india mexico nigeria pakistan and japan so beginning again with a language like esperanto would be wasteful the second argument is that english is used in modern technology far more that any other language most emails are sent in english and the vast majority of website use english

anything that distracts you from work
oh that s terrible what bad luck i wish we had never come to this country but if it isn t the strikes and the revolutionaries it s the earthquakes our operations here are finished

i m qualified for this position and i ve heard a lot of good things about your company
no 10 is my last word
