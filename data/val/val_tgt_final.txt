as we are a well established company we are very familiar with the customers needs besides we can make full use of our good connections with the wholesalers and retailers here and develop a good market for your products if appointed as your agent

beneficial i don t think so if two employees get married they will leave at the same time for a honeymoon or later one of them will stay at home taking care of babies if they break up the company will probably have to relocate one of them to make the workplace more comfortable by any means the company must spare extra efforts to solve problems brought by an office dating

cranberry juice is very good for destroying harmful bacteria in your guts because it s very acidic wild rice is high in fibre so it s good for your guts and it s high in protein and minerals i think it s also tastier than normal rice yoghurt s good because it s also rich in protein vitamins and is also acidic people have been making yoghurt for thousands of years and if you have it every day your guts will be much more settled

but if two employees are in love they will be happy happy people are more productive if they develop an intimate relation with each other they are willing to share knowledge and experience it can help to improve work efficiency
that s no problem he just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap that s easy and probably it s the same shop he got the boxes from maybe his friend works in an electronics store they sell video cameras there probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around so they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you twenty dollars a brick that s a good profit if they can sell enough bricks
i agree business cards are great tools for promoting personal business it won t take much time to design an amazing card but it can make a big difference among the crowd and you ll always notice it from your collection for they have outspoken colors own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card i wish to have one like this but for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow
i don t know about that with all the uncertainty in the markets right now it would be a very unwise decision to invest i don t know if you re aware son but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently there have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact the economy there s just too much instability i wouldn t feel comfortable investing in this climate
that s correct if you remember we also set a goal to double distribution in overseas markets now when looking at the data to evaluate whether or not we made our goals there are three things to consider first the original condition of the market second our marketing numbers from the previous year and third our final sales figures for this year now i want to describe for you the second and third parts if you look at the overhead you ll see a graph the blue line represents our sales from the year 2005 the red line is the sales in 2006 as you can see our sales in 2005 were quite slow to start off with but managed to make decent performance in the last part of the year on the other hand you can see this year s sales took off like a rocket
